# How to build
You'll need Qt5 installed and have and have a system environment variable called Qt5_DIR this must be set to the location in your Qt5 installation directory that contains Qt5Config.cmake.

In the case of windows this would tipically be: C:\Qt\5.10.1\msvc2017_64\lib\cmake\Qt5

Assuming that the installation is for MSVC with visual studio 2017 for a 64 Bit build target.
